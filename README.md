Simple Elm program described in an article published by Ricardo Miranda at Portugal@Programar on-line magazine, issue 52, http://www.revista-programar.info/anuncios/revista-programar-no-52-marco-de-2016/.
This program has a counter that starts at 100. If you left click your mouse over the number it increases one. You can set the count to zero clicking the button that says “Colocar a 0”.
