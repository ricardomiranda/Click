Simple Elm program described in an article published by Ricardo Miranda at Portugal@Programar on-line magazine, issue 52, http://www.revista-programar.info/anuncios/revista-programar-no-52-marco-de-2016/.
This program has a counter that starts at 100. If you left click your mouse over the number it increases by one. You can set the count to zero clicking the button that says “Colocar a 0”.
